### Create GitHub Repo

Git is a modern version control system.  There really is no other tool that offers a better solution for versioning files.

Git saves all of the versions of a set of files in a code repository, typically referred to as a Repo.  The repo allows users to manage multiple branches of code and provides explicit control over which branches are merge together.

Git helps many users to work together while preventing mishaps that naturally occur when many developers are working on the same set of code.

GitHub is a web service that manages Git Repos.  It provides a nice user interface to let people directly edit the code in the repos.  No longer is it necessary to even have the code on your local computer.  Of course it is sometimes convenient to work on code locally and then commit all of the changes back into the repo.

## Sync to GitHub Repo

GitBook lets you define a direct link between a GitBook and a code repo on GitHub.  For each GitBook project set up a GitHub repo that is automatically synchronized.  This is done with a GitHub integration.

* Create the GitBook project
* Setup the GitHub integration
* Clone the GitHub repo on your local computer
* Make commits on your local machine
* Push changes from your local computer to GitHub
* Verify that your changes are in the GitBook content
