# Planning Aspirations

What projects are you investing the most time in currently?

Assume a 100 hours week (14 hours * 7 days = 98 hours/week).  How does your
time split between work, people, grow, fun?

What is your ideal time investment profile?

My Ideal:

* Work 40%
* People 30%
* Fun 20%
* Grow 10%
